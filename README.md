# RICNN_RepeatGongCheng-sPaper
 This project which contain CNNs is Learning Rotation-Invariant Convolutional Neural Networks for Object Detection in VHR Optical Remote Sensing Images
### The RICNN is extract the rotation-invariant feature.
## How to work:
  1.python RICNN.py
  2.And you must set the training dataset path and testing dataset path in RICNN.py at first.
### Accuracy:
####   We use rotation-mnist-12k dataset for testing accuracy of RICNN, the accuracy is 98.03%
####   Name of dataset:rot-mnist-12K 32*32*1
####   So you should transform the image size before the run the network.
####   This network is run with Python 2.7 and Tensorflow 1.6.0
