# RICNN_RepeatGongCheng-sPaper
This project which contain CNNs is Learning Rotation-Invariant Convolutional Neural Networks for Object Detection in VHR Optical Remote Sensing Images
How to work:
   python RICNN.py
   And you must set the training dataset path and testing dataset path in RICNN.py at first.
Accuracy:
   We use rotation-mnist-12k dataset for testing accuracy of RICNN, the accuracy is 98.03%
   Name of dataset:rot-mnist-12K 32*32*1
   So you should transform the image size before the run the network.
